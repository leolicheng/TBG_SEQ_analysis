# TBG_SEQ_analysis
find mutations from sequence files

Step 1: Convert files to FASTQ (e.g. TraceTuner(https://sourceforge.net/projects/tracetuner/ or Sequence conversion) for ab1 files to FASTQ)

Step 2: Preprocess sequence files by FASTQC (e.g. generate FastQC Read Quality reports from online platform GALAXY)

Step 3: Analyze sequence files depending on different sequencing primer(T0023,T0024,T0128,T0133)

Step 4: Select mutation files, importing raw data(ab1 or FASTQ) to other sequence tools(Sequence Scanner Software v2.0) for double check 

Step 5: List all mutation files for further analysis
